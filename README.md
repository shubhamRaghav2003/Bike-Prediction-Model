# 🚲📈 Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

Step into the future of urban mobility with our **Bike Sharing Demand Prediction** project! 🌤️ This initiative leverages advanced predictive modeling techniques to forecast daily bike demand, integrating factors such as weather conditions, seasonal patterns, and holidays.

## Key Features 🚀

- **Predictive Modeling**: Built a powerful model using linear regression to predict daily bike sharing demand with precision.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved over 80% accuracy by fine-tuning the model through iterative training and validation processes.
- **Feature Optimization**: Utilized techniques like recursive feature elimination and variance inflation factor analysis to streamline the model, reducing feature count from 28 to 7 for improved efficiency.

## Technologies Utilized 💻

- **Python**: Applied Python for data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Linear Regression**: Chosen for its simplicity and effectiveness in modeling continuous data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Used to document the data exploration, model building, and insights in an interactive format.
